    *Project Report: Adding Image and Video Uploader Feature to Existing React
    Project* *Introduction:* The aim of this project was to enhance an existing
    React project by integrating image and video upload functionality using the
    react-dropzone library and Axios for making HTTP requests. Additionally, the
    project included the feature of storing video URLs in local storage for
    efficient retrieval and management. *Technologies Used:* 1. React: A
    JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 2. react-dropzone: A React
    component for handling file uploads with drag-and-drop functionality. 3.
    Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the server. 4.
    Local Storage: Web storage API used for storing data within the browser.
    *Project Overview:* The existing React project provided a solid foundation
    with its established components, routes, and state management. The goal was
    to seamlessly integrate the image and video uploader feature while ensuring
    compatibility with the existing codebase. *Implementation:* 1. *Integration
    of react-dropzone Component:* - Incorporated the react-dropzone component
    into existing components responsible for handling image and video uploads. -
    Configured react-dropzone to accept both image and video files. 2. *Axios
    Integration for File Uploads:* - Integrated Axios to handle HTTP requests
    for uploading images and videos to the server. - Utilized Axios POST
    requests to send files to the designated server endpoints. 3. *Handling
    Image Uploads:* - Modified existing components to handle image uploads using
    react-dropzone. - Implemented Axios requests to upload images to the server.
    4. *Handling Video Uploads:* - Extended the functionality to support video
    uploads alongside images. - Adapted Axios requests to handle video file
    uploads, ensuring proper handling of video formats and sizes. 5. *Local
    Storage Integration for Video URLs:* - Implemented logic to store the URLs
    of uploaded videos in local storage. - Used localStorage.setItem() to store
    video URLs upon successful upload. - Implemented functions to retrieve and
    display the stored video URLs when needed. *Challenges Faced:* 1. Ensuring
    compatibility and seamless integration with the existing React project
    structure. 2. Managing asynchronous nature of file uploads and handling
    errors effectively. 3. Proper validation and handling of different file
    types and sizes. *Conclusion:* In conclusion, this project successfully
    extended the functionality of the existing React project by adding image and
    video uploader features using react-dropzone and Axios. Additionally, the
    integration of local storage for storing video URLs enhances the usability
    and management of uploaded content. This project demonstrates the
    flexibility and scalability of React for incorporating new features into
    existing applications. *Future Enhancements:* 1. Implementing user
    authentication and authorization for secure file uploads. 2. Enhancing error
    handling and validation for improved user experience. 3. Adding additional
    features such as progress bars for file uploads and thumbnail previews. 4.
    Optimizing performance and scalability for handling large file uploads. By
    continuously iterating and improving upon the existing features, the project
    can evolve to meet the changing needs and requirements of its users.
